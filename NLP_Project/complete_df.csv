We have made some great strides, reaching $500 million in lending, over 100 employees, growing at 100% year-on-year - and we're barely getting started. $1 billion in lending is firmly in our sights, and we are committed to making financial services more rewarding to every Australian.  We believe the financial system has become bloated and inefficient, and are using technology and data to give value - and power - back to the consumer. The ambition is huge and the only way we can do this is by bringing the best people in the world to help us get there. That's where you come in.
